**NOTE: Since this driver, v2.0, made it to mainline kernel, this repository will be used for testing and development purposes.**

# Huawei WMI laptop extras linux driver
This driver adds support for some of the missing features found on Huawei laptops running linux. It implements Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) device mapping to kernel. Supported features are:
* Function hotkeys, implemented in v1.0
* Micmute LED, implemented in v2.0 & v3.0 (all models should work)
* Battery protection, implemented in v3.0
* Fn-lock, implemented v3.0

Battery protection and Fn-lock can be accessed from `/sys/devices/platform/huawei-wmi/{charge_thresholds,fn_lock_state}`

This driver requires kernel >= 5.0. If you're on kernel < 5.0, please refer to tag [v1.0](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI/tree/v1.0).

Check out [matebook-applet](https://github.com/nekr0z/matebook-applet) for a GUI
to control Fn-look and battery protection.

## Installation
Make sure you're using kernel >= 5.0.
You can get this driver from [here](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI/releases) if you want to use DKMS modules for easy installation.

### Use RPM package for Fedora/RHEL/CentOS

Install the RPM package provided [here](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI/releases).

### Use dkms tarball installation

1. Grab `huawei-wmi-VER-source-only.dkms.tar.gz` from [here](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI/releases)
2. Add dkms tarball and install module
Note: change `VER` to the desired module version.

```
$ sudo dkms ldtarball --archive=huawei-wmi-VER-source-only.dkms.tar.gz
$ # For autoinstallation
$ sudo dkms autoinstall -m huawei-wmi/VER
$ # For one-time installation
$ sudo dkms install huawei-wmi/VER
```

### Build from source

1. Make sure you have your kernel headers. In Fedora that would be:

```
$ sudo dnf install kernel-headers kernel-devel
```
Should be similar in other distributions.

2. Clone and *update* / *install* the module.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI
$ cd Huawei-WMI
$ make
$ # To update use:
$ sudo cp huawei-wmi.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/
$ sudo depmod
$ # To install use:
$ sudo make install
$ reboot
```

This method overwrites the exsiting version of `huawei-wmi` that comes with kernel 5.0. You have to redo it everytime the kernel gets updated.

## Keyboard
**NOTE: Ignore this if you're running `systemd-udev` > 240.**

One of the keys, `micmute`, wouldn't work after inserting the module and that is due to an issue with X.Org. The solution would be to remap it to using `udev` hwdb tables.
Copy `99-Huawei.hwdb` to `/etc/udev/hwdb.d/` then update the hwdb tables:
```
sudo udevadm --debug hwdb --update; sudo udevadm trigger
```

## TODO
* ~~Merge driver into upstream~~ Merged in Linux > 4.20. [Commit log](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/platform/x86/huawei-wmi.c?id=bf4fb28c6e74495de9e1e4ad359cd2272ac12c53)
* ~~Getting device LEDs to work~~ See `0003-ALSA-hda-add-support-for-Huawei-WMI-micmute-LED.patch`
* Support more devices
* ACPI driver?
